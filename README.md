# ASCII Art

## Introduction

A project that is just for fun to make ASCII clip art. Inspired by an assignment my peer received at Bellevue College in CSC 209. The idea is an app that prints ASCII animals with customizable strings of characters in their mouths.

### Project Scope and Limitations

This project was created in IntelliJ IDEA for students. At the time when I created this I was new to version control and did not use branching. This project is currently inactive. Some features I intended to add but did not have time for include:

* A graphical user interface in the Java Swing library
* Support for more ASCII animals.
* Allowing the animals printed to be interleaved while maintaining the string being printed.

More time between quarters would have allowed for me to maintain this project better. However, I have realized through the course of this project that software engineering is not my passion, despite being capable, and I am more interested in Data Science projects in my free time.

## Conclusion

This work demonstrates that I am capable of writing well documented and object oriented programs and taught me that it is best to work in branches, even on solo projects. In the future I hope to incorporate the lessons learned from this work into well thought out software that accomplishes a task that is more interesting to me.
